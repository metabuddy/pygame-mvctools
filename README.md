# pygame-mvctools

MvcTools is a high-level set of Python modules designed for writing games using the model-controller-view design pattern. 
It is written on top of Pygame.

The main purpose of this library is to easily design a game as a succession of states.
Each of these states owns its own model, view and controller for which base classes are provided. 
Other high level features are available, like resource handling and automatically updated sprites.
