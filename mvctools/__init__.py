"""mvctools is a high-level set of Python modules designed for writing games
using the model-controller-view design pattern. It is written on top of
Pygame. This allows you to easily design a game as a succesion of states.
Each of these states owns its own model, view and controller for which base
classes are provided. Other high level features are available, like the
ressource handler and automatically updated sprite.
